Insurance rule

Poker Insurance in Texas Hold’em

Poker Insurance is an optional feature offered by some live poker clubs to reduce variance in all-in situations. It allows a player who is ahead to protect against a possible bad outcome by securing part of the pot in advance.

In simple terms:
👉 You pay a small cost to protect yourself from losing when you are statistically ahead.

📌 When Is Insurance Available?
	•	An all-in occurs
	•	Not all community cards have been revealed (flop, turn, or river)
	•	Winning probabilities can be calculated
	•	The poker club offers insurance

🎯 Example
	•	Player A: AA
	•	Player B: KK
	•	All-in after the flop
	•	Player A equity: 80%
	•	Player B equity: 20%

Player A may choose to buy insurance.

If Player A buys insurance:
	•	Player A secures a payout based on the opponent’s winning probability (20%)
	•	The payout is guaranteed regardless of the final board

Final Result	Outcome for Player A
Player A wins	Wins the pot (minus insurance cost)
Player A loses	Receives the insurance payout to offset the loss

💰 How Is Insurance Calculated?

Insurance is usually calculated based on:
	•	Number of remaining outs
	•	Cards left to be dealt
	•	Total pot size

A house fee (edge) is included, meaning insurance is not EV-neutral for players over the long run.
